Discovering new music can be overwhelming due to the vast number of songs available. Current recommendation systems often struggle to capture individual tastes, leading to less personalized suggestions. This issue stems from a limited understanding of individual user preferences and the complex nuances of musical diversity. This project aims to address this issue by using real world playlist data to train a model that can generate more tailored recommendations. By analyzing patterns in user-created playlists and the attributes of included songs, this approach aims to discern and predict user preferences with greater accuracy than conventional recommendation systems. Overall, BopBuddy hope to simplify the process of finding new, enjoyable music for users!
